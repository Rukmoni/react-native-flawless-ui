# State Management

### Why do we need state at all

 State is the interface between your data from any kind of backend or local change 
 and the representation of this data with UI-elements in the frontend. 
 State is able to keep the data of different components in sync because each state update will rerender all relevant components. 


 ## Component state

 The state of a component is like the props which are passed to a component, 
 a plain JavaScript object containing information that influences the way a component is rendered. 
 In comparison, to the props, the state can be changed by the component itself 
 by calling `setState` which will trigger a re-render of the component. 
 The state API of React is really simple at all and doesn’t add too much complexity 
 to your application.

 ```js
 class Clock extends React.Component {
  state = {
    date: new Date(),
  };

  _refeshDate = () => this.setState({ date: new Date() });

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</Text>
        <Button
          title="Refesh"
          onPress={this._refeshDate}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
}
 ```

Your component dependencies and the size and complexity of your app grows you will 
find yourself by pushing the state up in your component-tree to inject the relevant 
state in several components. 
The distance between your states location and your components 
which need a certain part of the state will increase.

This leads to prop drilling, meaning passing props through components 
which don’t need the props but their children do. 
You want to avoid this because it increases the complexity, for example during a refactoring.


 ## Context API

The `Context API` was added to React in version `16.3.0 earlier` this year. 
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to 
pass props down manually at every level.

### When to Use Context ?

Context is designed to share data that can be considered `global` for a tree of React components, 
such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

```js
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
        <Toolbar />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}

const Toolbar = () => (
  <View>
    <ThemedButton />
  </View>
)

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  static contextType = ThemeContext;

  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.context} />;
  }
}
```
